# Welcome to the tRIBS-Model Organization!

This is the official GitHub home for the **tRIBS (TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator)** model and its associated tools. tRIBS is a physically-based, distributed hydrologic model used with a wide range of applications.

---

## About the Project

tRIBS is a C++ model that simulates the hydrologic processes of a watershed. Our goal is to provide a robust, open-source platform for hydrologic modeling and to foster a community of users and developers.

## Our Core Projects

Here are the main repositories managed by this organization:

*   **[tRIBS-Model/tRIBS](https://github.com/tRIBS-Model/tRIBS)**: The core C++ source code for the hydrologic model. This is where you'll find the latest developments.
*   **[tRIBS-Model/pytRIBS](https://github.com/tRIBS-Model/pytRIBS)**: A pre-to-post processing python package for tRIBS, making model setup and analysis much easier.
*   **[tRIBS-Model/rtdocs](https://github.com/tRIBS-Model/rtdocs)**: The source code for our official documentation and user wiki, hosted on Read the Docs.
*   **[tRIBS-Model/MeshBuilder](https://github.com/tRIBS-Model/MeshBuilder)**: A utility program required to generate files for parallel tRIBS simulations.

## Getting Started

The best place to start is with our official documentation.

**[Read the tRIBS Documentation on Read the Docs](https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** 

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting code, your help is appreciated.

All pull requests are reviewed by our [Core-Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/tRIBS-Model/teams/core-maintainers) before being merged.
